                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px; font-size: larger; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;">How do I make sure I choose the right dumpster size and don't overpay?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The best way is to talk to our team. Give us a detailed description of your project. An experienced professional can almost always accurately recommend the correct roll off dumpster size, which is the key to getting a cheap roll off dumpster rental by not paying for space you don't need.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How do you calculate the final weight of my debris?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">All of our trucks are required to go to a certified weigh station at the disposal facility. They weigh the truck when it's full (gross weight) and again after it's been emptied (tare weight). The difference between these two numbers is the exact, certified weight of your disposed material, a copy of which is available to you.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">What is a "trip fee" and how do I avoid it?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">A trip fee is a charge incurred if our driver arrives for a scheduled delivery or pickup and cannot complete the service due to an obstacle, like a parked car blocking the placement area. You can avoid it by ensuring the entire access path is clear and unobstructed on your service day.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Can the dumpster be placed on a city street in front of my business?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">In most municipalities, placing a roll off dumpster bin on a public street requires a permit from the city's department of public works or a similar entity. You, as the renter, are typically responsible for securing this permit before we can schedule the delivery.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">What materials are not allowed in dumpsters?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Hazardous waste, chemicals, asbestos, and certain electronics are prohibited. Our team provides a detailed list before delivery.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How long can I keep the dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Rental periods are flexible, ranging from short-term use to extended projects. Weâ€™ll work with you to match your schedule.</p>
